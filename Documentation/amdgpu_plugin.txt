ROCM Support(1)
===============

NAME
----
amdgpu_plugin - A plugin extension to CRIU to support checkpoint/restore in
userspace for AMD GPUs.


CURRENT SUPPORT
---------------
Single and Multi GPU systems (Gfx9)
Checkpoint / Restore on same system
Checkpoint / Restore inside a docker container
Pytorch

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Though *criu* is a great tool for checkpointing and restoring running
applications, it has certain limitations such as it cannot handle
applications that have device files open. In order to support *ROCm* based
workloads with *criu* we need to augment criu's core functionality with a
plugin based extension mechanism. *amdgpu_plugin* provides the necessary support
to criu to allow Checkpoint / Restore with ROCm.


Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*amdkfd support*::
    In order to snapshot the *VRAM* and other *GPU* device states, we require
    an updated version of amdkfd(amdgpu) driver. The kernel patches are under
    review currently.

*criu 3.16*::
    This work is rebased on latest criu release available at this time.
