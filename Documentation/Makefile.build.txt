NAME
----
Makefile.build - a bunch of helpers for simplified Makefiles


SYNOPSIS
--------
'make' -f scripts/Makefile.build obj=<dir>


DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is main build helpers script we use. Basically the idea is to minimize hand
work and describe Makefiles with somewhat simplified grammar.

The script may work in two modes

	- *Default mode*

	- *Target mode*

Following keywords are reserved and must not be used for anything else --
'targets', 'deps', 'all-obj', 'incdeps', 'obj-y', 'obj-e', 'asm-y', 'asm-e',
'file', 'libs-e', '<x>-obj-y', '<x>-obj-e', '<x>-asm-y', '<x>-asm-e',
'<x>-obj-y-cflags', '<x>-obj-e-cflags', '<x>-asm-y-asmflags', '<x>-asm-e-asmflags',
'<x>-libs-e'. Where '<x>' is a prefix of the target, will be explained below.
That said, do not use such names for other purposes as stated here.

OBJ=
----

Parameter *obj=* states for passing directory where simplified Makefile lays in.
Note the directory name must not end up with a slash, it is mandatory.

In your simplifiled Makefile you still can refer to it as '$(obj)' variable. If
you need an ending slash, just type it explicitly as '$(obj)/'.

DEFAULT MODE
------------

In *default* mode the script builds '$(obj)/built-in.o' relocatable file. To use
*default* mode do not ever mention '<x>-' and 'targets' variables in a Makefile.
This done for simplicity, otherwise more complex logic will be needed in the
script which slows down built procedure.

Thus in *default* mode the following variables may and should be referred

obj-y::
	Source code C file. Typically refered as *obj-y += 'some-file.o'*.
	This implies you have real 'some-file.c' in '$(obj)' directory.

obj-e::
	Same as 'obj-y' but implies that source code file lays in directory
	other than '$(obj)'. The postfix '-e' came from word 'external'.

asm-y::
	Source code S file. Same as 'obj-y' but for assembly language.

asm-e::
	Same as 'obj-e' but for assembly language.

lib-e::
	Some extarnal library the 'built-in.o' should link with.

incdeps::
	A flag which tells the script to generate dependency (that named '*.d'
	files)	for source code C files. To turn this functionality on just
	type 'incdeps := y' somewhere in your Makefile.

For example a simplified Makefile may look like

	obj-y += file1.o
	obj-y += file2.o
	obj-y += file3.o

	ifneq ($(MAKECMDGOALS),clean)
	incdeps := y
	endif

TARGET MODE
-----------

In *target* mode the script builds all targets declared in a Makefile. Thus the
final built relocatable files will have a name as '<x>.built-in.o', where '<x>'
is a name of a target (I will continue using '<x>' to refer the target name).
The following variables may be used for *target* mode.

targets::
	This one defines a target name to built.

<x>-obj-y::
	Same as 'obj-y' but per target.

<x>-obj-y-cflags::
	Additional compiler flags for this target and object files
	in '<x>-obj-y'.

<x>-obj-e::
	Same as 'obj-e' but per target.

<x>-obj-e-cflags::
	Additional compiler flags for this target and object files
	in '<x>-obj-e'.

<x>-asm-y::
	Same as 'asm-y' but per target.

<x>-asm-y-asmflags::
	Additional compiler flags for this target and object files
	in '<x>-asm-y'.

<x>-asm-e::
	Same as 'asm-e' but per target.

<x>-asm-e-asmflags::
	Additional compiler flags for this target and object files
	in '<x>-asm-e'.

<x>-libs-e::
	Same as 'libs-e' but per-target.

There might be a situation where we have several targets and each of them need
some object file to be linked in. In this case we need to use variables from
*default* mode. Better to explain with example.

Lets say we need to built two targets 'one' and 'two' (thus 'one.built-in.o' and
'two.built-in.o' relocatable files will be generated). For 'one' we need to use
files 'a.o', 'b.o', and for 'two' we need to use 'c.o' and 'd.o'. But both
targets need functionality from file 'e.o'. To force the script share the 'e.o'
we describe it as plain 'obj-y'.

	targets += one
	targets += two

	one-obj-y += a.o
	one-obj-y += b.o

	two-obj-y += c.o
	two-obj-y += d.o

	obj-y += e.o

The script will compile all files and link 'one.built-in.o' from files 'one-obj-y'
plus 'obj-y'. The same applies to the target 'two' ('obj-y' file will be linked
in as well).

Thus if you refer variables from *default* mode but have 'targets' defined, the
script will treat such variables as a sign to share the productions at moment
when targets get linked.

INVISIBLE RULES
---------------

If the script is used for build procedure then a couple of additional rules are
generated on the fly. Better to explain with example again.

Lets say we have a Makefile with the following contents

	obj-y += file.o

where $(obj) is a directory named 'dir'. So once we use the script we can
generate the following files.

make dir/file.o::
	To compile the file.

make dir/file.s::
	To generate assembly file from C file.

make dir/file.d::
	To generate dependency file.

make dir/file.i::
	To generate C file with preprocessor only.
