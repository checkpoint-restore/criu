NAME
----
criu - checkpoint/restore in userspace


SYNOPSIS
--------
*criu* '<command>' ['options']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
*criu* is a tool for checkpointing and restoring running applications.
It does this by saving their state as a collection of files (see the 'dump'
command) and creating equivalent processes from those files (see the 'restore'
command). The restore operation can be performed at a later time,
on a different system, or both.


OPTIONS
-------
The options are depending on the '<command>' *criu* run with.

Common options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Common options are applied to any '<command>'.

*-v*['<num>'|*v*...]::
    Set logging level to '<num>'. The higer the level, the more output
    is produced. Either numeric values or multiple *v* can be used.
    +
The following levels are available:
    * *-v1*, *-v*
        only messages and errors;
    * *-v2*, *-vv*
        also warnings (default level);
    * *-v3*, *-vvv*
        also information messages and timestamps;
    * *-v4*, *-vvvv*
        lots of debug.

*--pidfile* '<file>'::
    Write root task, service or page-server pid into a '<file>'.

*-o*, *--log-file* '<file>'::
    Write logging messages to '<file>'.

*--log-pid*::
    Write separate logging files per each pid.

*-D*, *--images-dir* '<path>'::
    Use path '<path>' as a base directory where to look for dump files set.

*--prev-images-dir* '<path>'::
    Use path '<path>' as a parent directory where to look for dump files set.
    This make sence in case of increment dumps.

*-W*, *--work-dir* '<dir>'::
    Use directory '<dir>' for putting logs, pidfiles and statistics. If not
    specified, '<path>' from *-D* option is taken.

*--close* '<fd>'::
    Close file with descriptor '<fd>' before any actions.

*-L*, *--libdir* '<path>'::
    Path to a plugins directory.

*--action-script* '<SCRIPT>'::
    Add an external action script.
    The environment variable *CRTOOLS_SCRIPT_ACTION* contains one of the
    actions:
        * *post-dump*
            run an action upon *dump* completion;

        * *post-restore*
            run an action upon *restore* completion;

        * *network-lock*
            lock network in a target network namespace;

        * *network-unlock*
            unlock network in a target network namespace;

        * *setup-namespaces*
            run an action once root task just been created
            with required namespaces, note it is early stage
            on restore nothing were restored yet except namespaces
            themselves.

*-V*, *--version*::
    Print program version and exit.

*-h*, *--help*::
    Print a commands list and exit. The commands list is very
    short one just for overview and does not match this manual.

*pre-dump*
~~~~~~~~~~
Launches that named pre-dump procedure, where *criu* does snapshot of
memory changes since previous pre-dump. Also *criu* forms fsnotify
cache which speedup *restore* procedure. *pre-dump* requires at least
*-t* option (see *dump* below). Optionally *page-server* options
may be specified.

*--track-mem*::
    Turn on memory changes tracker in the kernel. If the option is
    not passed the memory tracker get turned on implicitly.

*dump*
~~~~~~
Starts a checkpoint procedure.

*-t*, *--tree* '<pid>'::
    Checkpoint the whole process tree starting from '<pid>'.

*-R*, *--leave-running*::
    Leave tasks in running state after checkpoint instead of killing them. This
    option is pretty dangerous and should be used if and only if you understand
    what you are doing.
+
If task is about to run after been checkpointed it can modify TCP connections,
delete files and do other dangerous actions. So that *criu* itself can not
guarantee that the next *restore* action will not fail. Most likely if a user
starts *criu* with this option passed at least the file system snapshot must be
done with help of 'post-dump' script.
+
In other words, do not use it until really needed.

*-s*, *--leave-stopped*::
    Leave tasks in stopped state after checkpoint instead of killing them.

*-x*, *--ext-unix-sk*::
    Dump external unix sockets.

*--manage-cgroups*::
    Collect cgroups into the image thus they gonna be restored then.
    Without this argument *criu* will not save cgroups configuration
    associated with a task.

*--tcp-established*::
    Checkpoint established TCP connections.

*--veth-pair* '<IN>'*=*'<OUT>'::
    Correspondence between outside and inside names of veth devices.

*--evasive-devices*::
    Use any path to a device file if the original one is inaccessible.

*--page-server*::
    Send pages to a page server (see *page-server* command).

*--force-irmap*::
    Force resolving names for inotify and fsnotify watches.

*--auto-dedup*::
    Deduplicate "old" data in pages images of previous *dump*. Which implies
    incremental *dump* mode (see *pre-dump* command).

*-l*, *--file-locks*::
    Dump file locks. It is necessary to make sure that all file lock users
    are taken into dump, so it is only safe to use this for enclojured containers
    where locks are not holed by someone outside of it.

*-M*, *--ext-mount-map* '<KEY>'*:*'<VAL>'::
    Setup mapping for external mounts. '<KEY>' is a mountpoint inside container
    and corresponding '<VAL>' is a string that will be written into the image
    as mountpoint\'s root value.

*--link-remap*::
    Allow one to link unlinked files back when possible (modifies FS till *restore*).

*--ghost-limit* 'size'::
    Allow one to specify maximum allowed size of deleted file to be carried
    inside image files. By default up to 1M file is allowed. It is done in
    a sake to not carry big files inside images. 'size' may be postfixed
    with 'K', 'M' or 'G' (which stands for kilo, mega and gigabytes accordingly).

*-j*, *--shell-job*::
    Allow one to dump shell jobs. This implies the restored task will inherit session and
    process group ID from the criu itself. Also this option allows one to migrate a
    single external tty connection, in other words this option allows one to migrate
    such application as "top" and friends. If passed on *dump* it must be
    specified on *restore* as well.

*--cpu-cap* [,'<cap>']::
    Specify 'cap' CPU capability to be written into an image file. Basically
    if '<cap>' is one of *all*, *cpu* or *ins*, then *criu* writes CPU related
    information into image file. If the option is omitted or set to *none*
    then image will not be written. By default *criu* do not write this image.

*restore*
~~~~~~~~~
Restores previously checkpointed processes.

*--inherit-fd* 'fd[<num>]:<existing>'::
    Inherit file descriptors. This allows one to treat file descriptor '<num>' as
    being already opened via '<existing>' one and instead of trying to open we
    inherit it.

*-d*, *--restore-detached*::
    Detach *criu* itself once restore is complete.

*-S*, *--restore-sibling*::
    Restore root task as a sibling (make sense with *--restore-detached*) only.

*-r*, *--root* '<path>'::
    Change the root filesystem to <path> (when run in mount namespace).

*--manage-cgroups* [<mode>]::
    Restore cgroups configuration associated with a task from the image.
    Controllers are always restored in optimistic way -- if already present
    in system *criu* reuses it, otherwise it will be created.
+
The '<mode>' may be one of below.

    - *none*.   Do not restore cgroup properties but require cgroup to
                pre-exist at the moment of *restore* procedure.

    - *props*.  Restore cgroup properties and require cgroup to pre-exist.

    - *soft*.   Restore cgroup properties if only cgroup has been created
                by *criu*, otherwise do not restore properies.

    - *full*.   Always restore all cgroups and their properties.

    - *strict*. Restore all cgroups and their properties from the scratch,
                requiring them to not present in the system.

*--cgroup-root* '[<controller>:]/<newroot>'::
    Change the root cgroup the controller will be installed into. No controller
    means that root is the default for all controllers not specified.

*--tcp-established*::
    Restore previously dumped established TCP connections. This implies that
    the network has been locked between *dump* and *restore* phases so other
    side of a connection simply notice a kind of lag.

*--veth-pair* '<IN>'*=*'<OUT>'::
    Correspondence between outside and inside names of veth devices.

*-l*, *--file-locks*::
    Restore file locks from the image.

*-M*, *--ext-mount-map* '<KEY>'*:*'<VAL>'::
    Setup mapping for external mounts. '<KEY>' is the value from the image
    ('<VAL>' from dump) and the '<VAL>' is the path on host that will be
    bind-mounted into container (to the mountpoint path from image).

*--ext-mount-map* *auto*::
    This is a special case. If this flag is passed, when an external
    mount is missing from the command line '*--ext-mount-map* <KEY>:<VAL>' syntax,
    criu attempts to automatically resolve this mount from its namespace.

*--enable-external-sharing*, *--enable-external-masters*::
    These flags enable external shared or slave mounts to be resolved
    automatically when '*--ext-mount-map auto*' is passed.

*--auto-dedup*::
    As soon as a page is restored it get punched out from image.

*-j*, *--shell-job*::
    Restore shell jobs, in other words inherit session and process group
    ID from the criu itself.

*--cpu-cap* ['<cap>','<cap>']::
    Specify '<cap>' CPU capability to be present on the CPU the process is
    restoring. To inverse capability prefix it with *^*. This option implies
    that *--cpu-cap* has been passed on *dump* as well, except *fpu* option
    case.

    - *all*.    Require all capabilities. This is *default* mode if *--cpu-cap*
                is passed without arguments. Most safe mode.

    - *cpu*.    Require the CPU to have all capabilities in image to match
                runtime CPU.

    - *fpu*.    Requre the CPU to have comaptible FPU. For example the process
                might be dumped with xsave capability but attempted to restore
                without it present on target CPU. In such case we refuse to
                procceed. This is *default* mode if *--cpu-cap* is not present
                in command line. Note this argument might be passed even if
                on the *dump* no *--cpu-cap* have been specified becase FPU
                frames are always encoded into images.

    - *ins*.    Require CPU compatibility on instructions level.

    - *none*.   Ignore capabilities. Most dangerous mode. The behaviour is
                implementation dependent. Try to not use it until really
                required.
+
One possible need of using this option is when
*--cpu-cap*=*cpu* has been passed on *dump* then images are
migrated to a less capable processor and one need to *restore*
this application, by default *criu* will refuse to proceed without
relaxing capability with *--cpu-cap*=*none* parameter.

*check*
~~~~~~~
Tests whether the kernel support is up to date.

*--ms*::
    Do not check not yet merged features.

*--feature* '<name>'::
    Check a particular feature. Instead of checking everything one may specify
    which exactly feature is to be tested. The '<name>' may be: *mnt_id*,
    *aio_remap*, *timerfd*, *tun*, *userns*.

*page-server*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Launches *criu* in page server mode.

*--daemon*::
    Runs page server as a daemon (background process).

*--address* '<address>'::
    Page server IP address.

*--port* '<number>'::
    Page server port number.

*exec*
~~~~~~
Executes a system call inside a destination task\'s context.

*service*
~~~~~~~~~
Launches *criu* in RPC daemon mode where *criu* is listeninп for
RPC commands over socket to perform. This is convenient for the
case where daemon itself is running in a privilege (superuser) mode
but clients are not.

dedup
~~~~~
Starts pagemap data deduplication procedure, where *criu* scans over all
pagemap files and tries to minimalize the number of pagemap entries by
obtaining the references from a parent pagemap image.

*cpuinfo* *dump*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fetches current CPU features and write them into an image file.

*cpuinfo* *check*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fetches current CPU features (ie CPU the *criu* is running on) and test if
they are compatible with ones present in image file.


SYSCALLS EXECUTION
------------------

To run a system call in another task\'s context use

----------
    criu exec -t pid syscall-string
----------

command. The 'syscall-string' should look like

----------
    syscall-name syscall-arguments ...
----------

Each command line argument is transformed into the system call argument by
the following rules:

* If one starts with *&*, the rest of it gets copied to the target task\'s
  address space and the respective syscall argument is the pointer to this
  string;

* Otherwise it is treated as a number (converted with strtol) and is directly
  passed into the system call.


EXAMPLES
--------
To checkpoint a program with pid of *1234* and write all image files into
directory *checkpoint*:

----------
    criu dump -D checkpoint -t 1234
----------

To restore this program detaching criu itself:

----------
    criu restore -d -D checkpoint
----------

To close a file descriptor number *1* in task with pid *1234*:

----------
    criu exec -t 1234 close 1
----------

To open a file named */foo/bar* for read-write in the task with pid *1234*:

----------
    criu exec -t 1234 open '&/foo/bar' 2
----------
