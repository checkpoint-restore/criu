/*
 * page_pipe is a descriptor of task's virtual memory
 * with pipes, containing pages.
 *
 * A page-pipe may contain holes -- these are pagemap
 * entries without pages. Holes are stored in separate
 * array to optimize paged iovs feed into vmsplice --
 * they will be sent there in one go.
 *
 * A hole is a pagemap entry that doesn't have pages
 * in it, since they are present in previous (parent)
 * snapshot.
 *
 *
 * This page-pipe vs holes vs task vmem vs image layout
 * is described below.
 *
 * Task memory: (+ present, - not present pages)
 *    0  0  0    0     1      1   1
 *    0  3  6    B     1      8   C
 *    ---+++-----++++++-------++++----
 *
 * Page-pipe iovs:
 *
 *    bufs = 03:3,0B:6,18:4
 *    holes = <empty>
 *
 * The pagemap.img would purely contain page-pipe bufs.
 *
 * Pages image will contain pages at
 *
 *    03,04,05,0B,0C,0D,0E,0F,10,18,19,1A,1B
 *
 * stored one by one.
 *
 * Not let's imagine task touches some pages and its mem
 * looks like: (+ present, = old present, - non present)
 *
 *    0  0  0    0     11    11   1
 *    0  3  6    B     12    78   C
 *    ---==+-----====+++-----++===----
 *
 * (not new pages at 11 and 17 vaddrs)
 *
 * The new --snapshot'ed page-pipe would look like
 *
 *    bufs = 05:1,0F:3,17:2
 *    holes = 03:2,0B:4,19:3
 *
 * So the pagemap.img would look like
 *
 *    03:2:P,05:1,0B:4:P,0F:3,17:2,19:3:P
 *
 * (the page_xfer_dump_pages generates one)
 *
 * where P means "in parent", i.e. respective pages should
 * be looked up in the parent pagemap (not pages.img, but
 * the pagemap, and then the offset in previous pages.img
 * should be calculated, see the read_pagemap_page routine).
 *
 * New pages.img file would contain only pages for
 *
 *    05,0F,10,11,17,18
