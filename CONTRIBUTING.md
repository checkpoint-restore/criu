## How to contribute to CRIU

CRIU project is (almost) the never-ending story, because we have to always keep up with the
Linux kernel supporting checkpoint and restore for all the features it provides. Thus we're
looking for contributors of all kinds -- feedback, bug reports, testing, coding, writing, etc.
Here are some useful hints to get involved.

* We have both -- [very simple](https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) and [more sophisticated](https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+feature%22) coding tasks;
* CRIU does need [extensive testing](https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atesting);
* Documentation is always hard, we have [some information](https://criu.org/Category:Empty_articles) that is to be extracted from people's heads into wiki pages as well as [some texts](https://criu.org/Category:Editor_help_needed) that all need to be converted into useful articles;
* Feedback is expected on the github issues page and on the [mailing list](https://lists.openvz.org/mailman/listinfo/criu);
* We accept github pull requests and this is the preferred way to contribute to CRIU. If you prefer to send patches by email, you are welcome to send them to [the devel list](http://criu.org/How_to_submit_patches);
* Spread the word about CRIU in [social networks](http://criu.org/Contacts);
* If you're giving a talk about CRIU -- let us know, we'll mention it on the [wiki main page](https://criu.org/News/events);
